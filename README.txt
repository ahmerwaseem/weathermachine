A project idea from Free Code Camp. Implement a weather application.

Basic Requirements:
	1. Acquire location from browser.
	2. Make an api call.
	3. Process and display weather information.
	4. Allow user to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and vice versa.

Add ons:
	1. Search option.
	2. Display images. 
	3. Convert all data from metric to imperial, and vice versa.

Gain experienced with:
	1. Javascript
	2. SCSS & CSS
	3. JQuery
	4. HTML

Stumbling blocks:
	1. Discovering Javascript is asynchronous
		a. Was trying to use a global variable declared in a callback function.
	2. Compiling SCSS
		a. Downloaded Ruby
	3. Making it look half way decent
		a. Functionality easier than aesthetics.
